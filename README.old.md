## Build a To-Do List Web Application ( Time limit: 2 Hours)
### Description:
You are tasked with building a To-Do List web application using Node.js, ReactJS, and
TypeScript. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, and status (e.g., pending, completed). The
application should persist tasks to a backend server using RESTful API endpoints.
### Requirements:
1. The backend server should be built using Node.js and Express.js.
2. Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend code.
3. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
4. Use ReactJS for the front end.
5. Design the UI/UX of the application with responsiveness in mind.
6. Implement validation for input fields (e.g., task title should not be empty).
7. Utilize proper error handling on both the front end and back end.
8. Ensure the codebase follows best practices, including proper code organization,
naming conventions, and documentation where necessary.
9. Use Git for version control. Please commit your changes regularly and write
meaningful commit messages.
10. Deploy the application to a hosting service of your choice (e.g., Heroku, Netlify).
### Bonus (Optional):
● Implement user authentication and authorization.
● Add search and filter functionalities for tasks.
● Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.
● Include tests for backend and frontend code.

## Deployment
