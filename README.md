# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Build a To-Do List Web Application ( Time limit: 2 Hours)
### Description:
You are tasked with building a To-Do List web application using Node.js, ReactJS, and
TypeScript. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
Each task should have a title, description, and status (e.g., pending, completed). The
application should persist tasks to a backend server using RESTful API endpoints.

### Requirements:
1. The backend server should be built using Node.js and Express.js.
2. Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend code.
3. Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
4. Use ReactJS for the front end.
5. Design the UI/UX of the application with responsiveness in mind.
6. Implement validation for input fields (e.g., task title should not be empty).
7. Utilize proper error handling on both the front end and back end.
8. Ensure the codebase follows best practices, including proper code organization,
naming conventions, and documentation where necessary.
9. Use Git for version control. Please commit your changes regularly and write
meaningful commit messages.
10. Deploy the application to a hosting service of your choice (e.g., Heroku, Netlify).

### Bonus (Optional):
● Implement user authentication and authorization.
● Add search and filter functionalities for tasks.
● Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks.
● Include tests for backend and frontend code.
